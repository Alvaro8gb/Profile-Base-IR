# Information Retrieval Engine Project

## Installation 


```code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Exercise 
### Statement

The student is required to implement an information retrieval engine targeted at delivering small text snippets to different users depending on their profile. For instance, let us suppose that we have 4 different users: the first one being interested in politics and soccer, the second in music and films, the third in cars and politics and the fourth in soccer alone. An incoming document targeted at politics should be delivered to users 1 and 3, while a document on soccer should be delivered to users 1 and 4. This assignment can be done in groups of 2-3 people, although it is also possible to do it individually.

### Mandatory Part (up to 7/10 points)

Students must submit a written report of at least 10 pages explaining the method used to encode both the documents and the user profiles, together with the algorithm used to process the queries (the more efficient, the better). In addition, the student must provide an implementation of the proposed method using the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook. Note that all the required stuff to execute the program must be provided (i.e. automatically installed) by the notebook.

### Optional Part I (up to 1.5 additional points)

The student must conduct a detailed assessment of the performance of the created IR model using the evaluation methods discussed in class. Note that the instructor already provided sample code that implements most of them. For the evaluation of your method, you can use any dataset (documents, queries, and relevance judgments) downloaded from the Internet (see e.g., TREC, SMART, OSHUMED, or any other downloaded from Kaggle).

### Optional Part II (up to 1.5 additional points)

Compare the performance of your method against other methods implemented by other groups. To do so, it is required that both groups use the test set (queries + relevance judgments).

### Instructions for Submission

The group will choose one representative who is responsible for uploading the assignment to Moodle. Note that the representative is the only one that must submit the assignment to Moodle. The rest of the group members will be cited on the cover page of the written report. All the submitted files must be compressed into a single ZIP file and uploaded to Moodle.
